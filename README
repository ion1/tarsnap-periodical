tarsnap-periodical â€“ call from cron to run tarsnap periodically

USAGE: tarsnap-periodical OPTION...

Required options:
  -p, --snapshot-path=PATH    The path to be snapshotted by tarsnap
  -n, --num-snapshots=NUM     The number of snapshots to keep

Other options:
  -h, --help                  Display this help
  -l, --size-limit=LIMIT      The size limit for PATH in bytes. If PATH is
                              bigger, the snapshot will be aborted. This is to
                              avoid surprises in case PATH accidentally gains
                              size.
  -f, --timestamp-format=FMT  The current time, formatted by FMT, will be
                              included in the snapshot name. If a snapshot by
                              such name already exists, the snapshot will be
                              aborted. If the timestamp format has a precision
                              of a day, a snapshot can be only taken once a
                              day. Default: %Y%m%d
